- Routes are defined in `src/routes/` using TanStack Router's file-based routing
- Components are Solid JS components in `src/components/`
- Static assets like images can be placed in the `public/` directory

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## 🐳 Docker Development

Test the production build locally using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Build and start the container
pnpm docker:up

# View logs
pnpm docker:logs

# Stop the container
pnpm docker:down
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The SQLite database will be persisted in `./data/` directory.

This matches the production environment on Fly.io, making it useful for:

- Testing the production build locally before deploying
- Debugging deployment issues
- Verifying volume mounting and database persistence

## 🚢 Deployment

This application is configured for deployment to [Fly.io](https://fly.io) with SQLite persistence.

### Prerequisites

1. Install the [Fly.io CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)
2. Create a Fly.io account: `fly auth signup` or `fly auth login`

### Initial Setup

**First time deployment:**

```bash
# Run from workspace root (/Users/jamesrosen/Code/PickMyFruit)

# 1. Set your app name in fly.toml (replace 'pickmyfruit')
# 2. Create the app and volume (but don't deploy yet)
pnpm deploy:setup

# 3. Create the persistent volume for SQLite
fly volumes create data --size 1 --region sjc

# 4. Deploy the application
pnpm deploy
```

**Note:** All deployment commands should be run from the **workspace root**, not from `apps/www/`, since the `fly.toml` and monorepo configuration are at the root level.

### Subsequent Deployments

```bash
# Deploy latest changes
pnpm deploy

# View logs
pnpm logs

# SSH into the running instance
pnpm ssh
```

### Verify Deployment

After deployment, verify the application is running:

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.fly.dev/api/health

# Open in browser
fly open
```

### Database Management

To run database migrations or seed data in production:

```bash
# SSH into the production machine
pnpm ssh

# Inside the machine:
cd /app
DATABASE_URL=file:/app/data/production.db pnpm db:push
DATABASE_URL=file:/app/data/production.db pnpm db:seed
```

### Configuration

Key configuration files:

- `../../fly.toml` - Fly.io deployment configuration (workspace root)
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for Node.js + SQLite (monorepo-aware)
- `../../.dockerignore` - Files excluded from Docker build (workspace root)
- `.env` - Local environment variables (not deployed)

**Note:** The `.dockerignore` file must be at the workspace root because Fly.io's `build.ignorefile` setting resolves relative to the working directory (where you run `fly deploy`).

Production environment variables are set in `fly.toml` under `[env]`.

### Troubleshooting

**Volume not mounting:**

```bash
fly volumes list
fly volumes create data --size 1 --region sjc
```

**Health check failing:**

```bash
fly logs
# Check /api/health endpoint is responding
```

**Database connection issues:**

```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
fly ssh console -C "env | grep DATABASE"
# Should show: DATABASE_URL=file:/app/data/production.db
```
