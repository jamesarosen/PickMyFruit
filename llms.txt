# Project: Pick My Fruit

## Project Description
A site for gardeners to share surplus produce with their community.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Solid JS, TanStack Router, TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite
- Database: SQLite, Drizzle ORM
- Testing: Vitest
- Authentication: Better Auth
- Deployed environment: Fly.io, via Docker

## Code Conventions
- Prettier for formatting
- ESLint for linting
- 1-tab indentation
- camelCase for variables and functions
- PascalCase for components and classes
- Use semantic names for variables and functions to document what they do. Use comments to document why, especially for non-intuitive or unusual code.
- Use idiomatic Solid JS, TanStack Router, TypeScript, SQLite.
- Use context7

## Project Structure

We use a monorepo structure

- /apps/www - a Solid JS + TanStack Router application
	- /src
		- /assets - images and other assets transformed by Vite
		- /components - Reusable Solid JS components and their related CSS
		- /routes - Page components (TanStack Router file-based routing) and their related CSS
		- /data - SQL schema, SQL queries, and TypeScript wrappers
		- /lib - Utility functions
		- /styles - Global styles and CSS
	- /public - Static assets, not transformed by Vite
	- /tests - Test files
- /packages/ - libraries extracted for reuse across applications

## Goals
- 30 days (2025-11-04): MVP with 10 beta users in one city. Manual matching OK. 3 successful fruit transfers.
- 60 days (2025-12-04): Add gleaning group support. Partner with 1-2 food banks/orgs. 20 total rescues.
- 90 days (2026-01-03): Automation complete. One week of transfers without founder intervention.
- 180 days (2026-04-03): Expand to 2-3 cities. 100 total rescues. Identify strongest user segment.
- 365 days (2026-10-05): Revenue model identified. 500+ rescues. <2 hrs/week maintenance required.

## Important Notes
- Validate input at system boundaries with Zod
- HTML: write semantically-meaningful and accessible markup
- Styling: Do not use Tailwind. Use CSS layers and variables. Keep CSS near the relevant components
- Use SQLite for the data layer
- Use the ORM for simple operations; use SQL and prepared statements for complex ones
- Use Solid JS for reactive UI components
- Routes are defined using TanStack Router's file-based routing
