# Pick My Fruit

[Pick My Fruit](http://pickmyfruit.com) is a website that helps neighbors share fruit and other produce that would otherwise go to waste.

## Goals

1. Rescue the most food and make productive use of it
2. Feed the most people

## Values

- Stewardship Over Ownership
- Abundance Through Connection
- Practical Urgency

## License & Commercial Aspects

Pick My Fruit is made by the community, for the community. Our source-code is free and open-source (generally Apache-2.0).

We may ask for donations or pursue other revenue streams, but only to further the mission. Profit is explicitly _not_ a motive.
