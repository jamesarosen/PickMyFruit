This document is more stable at the top, less at the bottom.

# Motto

Blessed are those who plant trees under which they will never sit.

# Bottom Line

Pick My Fruit has a double bottom line:

1. Rescue the most food and make productive use of it
2. Feed the most people

Both are measured on the time scale that includes “our grandchildren,” which is currently decades into the future. This is much longer than the typical corporation, but much shorter than the proverbial “Seventh Generation.”

# Core Values

## Stewardship Over Ownership
We treat food, land, and relationships as resources to protect and improve for those who come after us. Every fruit tree, every volunteer connection, every process we build should leave things better than we found them. This means thinking beyond this season's harvest to the health of the orchard, the soil, and the community networks that will sustain this work for our grandchildren.

## Abundance Through Connection
Food waste exists alongside hunger because of broken connections, not scarcity. We create pathways that reconnect abundance to need—linking tree owners with harvesters, surplus with hungry families, knowledge with action. We measure success not just in pounds rescued, but in the strength and resilience of the networks we build between people, food sources, and communities.

## Practical Urgency
Every piece of fruit matters today, and the systems we build matter for decades. We act with the urgency that food rotting demands, while building infrastructure that outlasts any single harvest season. We're pragmatic—we'll use duct tape when needed and build for permanence when we can. We don't let perfect be the enemy of feeding someone today or building something that works tomorrow.

# SWOT

## Strengths
- Deep technical expertise (25 years building web software across sectors)
- Intellectually capable founder who grasps business fundamentals

## Weaknesses
- No proven revenue model yet
- Limited experience in branding, GTM, and growth
- Solo operation (no team leverage)

## Opportunities
- NextDoor shows daily unmet demand for food sharing
- Multiple potential user segments (peer gleaners, organized groups, commercial buyers, seed libraries, land-sharing)
- Many viable paths

## Threats
- Direction ambiguity—too many viable paths could diffuse focus
- Mission drift risk when pursuing revenue
- Larger players could enter the space

# Operating Principles

## Think in portfolios
Under- and over-diversification are real risks to a portfolio.
When making a decision, consider using a portfolio approach. Try a few, eliminate losers, invest in winners.
When making a decision, consider how it acts within broader portfolios.

## Incentives Matter
Make the right thing the easy thing. Design for the pit of success. When problems arise, examine what behaviors the system rewards before assuming bad actors.

## Build for Absence
Design systems that work when you’re not there. Every process, every piece of documentation, every automation should assume the builder won’t be available. This creates the space for deep work today and ensures the mission outlasts any individual tomorrow.
